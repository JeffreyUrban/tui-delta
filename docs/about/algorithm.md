# How tui-delta Works

A detailed look at the algorithm behind processor.

## Core Algorithm

tui-delta uses TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER.

### The Process

1. **TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER** TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER

## Key Concepts

### TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER

## Memory Efficiency

### TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity

- **TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER**: O(TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER)

### Space Complexity

- **TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER**: O(TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER)

## Oracle Compatibility

tui-delta's algorithm is validated against an **oracle implementation** - a simple, obviously-correct but slower reference implementation.

All edge cases and complex scenarios are verified to match oracle behavior exactly.
